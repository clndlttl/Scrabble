# Scrabble

Welcome to my Scrabble server repo! This project is implemented using Python and Flask, designed to bring a bit of fun to your Local Area Network (LAN). With this server, you and your team can enjoy engaging Scrabble games, adding a delightful distraction to your workplace.

## On a computer connected to your LAN:
- Install Docker and get the Docker engine running
- Clone this repo and cd inside
- Run "sudo ./build.sh"
- Note the ip address of the server. On any other system on your LAN, visit that ip address in a web browser
- Game on!
